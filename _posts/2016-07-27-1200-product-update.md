## Email subscriptions for Reports

You can now subscribe and receive reports via email.

![email subscriptions](/img/2016-07-26-email-subscriptions.png)

You'll have the option of receiving emails:

- Daily
- Weekly on a specific day of the week
- Monthly on a specific day of the month

The email will contain a PDF of your report and a link to view the report on Clockwise.MD.

Tip: If you want end of month reports, select the 1st and it'll run at 5am on the 1st of the month.

Bonus Tip: If you want to send the report to multiple people, we recommend setting up a distribution
list with your email administrator.

## Whitelisting Reports domains

Now that Reports are a key part of our ability to deliver information about your clinic, patients
and staff - it would make sense that you should be able to access it.

At some hospitals, we have to "whitelist" domains for access. That means we need to let your IT
know which systems Clockwise.MD needs access to in order to function.

If you're having problems viewing reports (i.e. you just see a blank screen), then we need to
whitelist more domains with your IT Security team.

The list of domains is available in our [IT README](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tB5q1r-9OrK6DHPTe6DL28pByIbI2vcyESaSfQln4yk/edit#heading=h.4n7z0z9x1jiw).

You can also reach out to us at [support@clockwisemd.com](mailto:support@clockwisemd.com) and
we'll get that process started.

## Clockwise Survey for Athena Integrated Customers

Now patients entered directly into Clockwise.MD or directly into Athena will both receive SMS text
surveys. Clockwise.MD now sends the post-discharge SMS survey if the "consent to text" box is
checked within Athena.

## Clockwise Survey can get you more than a score

Clockwise Survey can now be used to gather free-text feedback, Net Promotor Scores&reg;, or both!
Patient's qualitative feedback can be used to guide service recovery efforts for patients who have
had a negative experience.

## Today's Patients

Today's Patients will receive multiple feature enhancements to allow for easier and more frequent
access including sorting and filtering. We'll also make it easier to show and hide columns by
creating views with common column configurations. As more information is being added to Today's
Patients, we'll make it easier for you to see what you want and export that data easily into CSVs
to manipulate and use.

<div class='updates notice'>

Some functionality is already available now. More functionality will be released throughout August.

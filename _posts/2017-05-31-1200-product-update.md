## Blank PDF Reports and New Email Reports

Our Reporting functionality is provided by [Periscope Data](https://www.periscopedata.com/).
They give Clockwise the ability to visualize charts and generate graphs.
Their recent upgraded UI has broken our ability to reliably capture PDF files on your daily,
weekly or monthly email reports.

Luckily we were already working on some new functionality and we're almost done wrapping up the
ability to include data directly into emails. Soon, PDFs will no longer be necessary to view
basic stats that would've been attached. We hope to start testing this system as soon as next week
and roll it out in late-June.

In the meantime, please continue to use the link in the email to jump directly into Clockwise to
view the report if the attachment doesn't work.

Coming in late-June.

## Calendar Events

We now support "Add to your Calendar" links for patients on the confirmation page and as
attachments on confirmation emails. This allows patients the ability to add appointment details
to their calendar from their devices including a reminder and the facility's address.

There are three links on the confirmation page to support:

- Google using a direct calendar link
- Outlook using VCS files
- Calendar using ICS files

Reach out to our [Support Team](http://clockwisemd.desk.com/) to enable this functionality on your
clinics and hospitals.

<div class='updates notice'>

Available now. Please contact Support or your Account Manager for details on enabling.

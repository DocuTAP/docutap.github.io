Features include:

- Sorting columns
- Editable fields
- Filtering
- Views
- Patient data across groups

### Sorting columns and editable fields

Each column will have the ability to sort by clicking on the column header.

Custom fields can also be enabled for editing making Today's Patients into an editable dashboard.
This allows for flexibility around managing your survey results or adding post-encounter notes.

Available now to early access customers and will continue to roll out to all customers this week.

### Filtering and Views

Filtering allows for limiting your results to just the patients you want to look at. Instead of
downloading a CSV and hiding rows in your favorite spreadsheet tool, we'll offer some simple
filtering options for quick lookups and searches.

Views allows for pre-defined column selections without having to manually select each column
every time you visit Today's Patients.

When we combine these two features, we'll have the ability to provide you with filtered views to
easily review patients. This includes:

- Low survey scores with their scores and responses
- High survey scores with their qualitative feedback
- Patients that were delayed
- Only walk-in patients
- Patients who waited more than an hour

We hope to work with customers looking forward to this on which pre-defined filters and views they
think would be useful.

### Patient data across groups

For larger customers with multiple locations, we tie hospitals together into groups. As we
continue building functionality into Today's Patients, we'll add the ability to search for and
view patients across multiple hospitals within your group.

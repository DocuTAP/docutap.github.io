#### Features

- {:.feature} This feature will function for a patient in English or Spanish.  In order to enable this text to an existing configuration, you need to disable the message , save it and then enable it back within Settings > Text Messages > Pager Message.  After this action the following will appear at the end of the text: Text HERE when you arrive at the clinic.  When the patient texts "Here" the application will mark them as checked in.  This gives them the option to wait for their appointment in their car.
- {:.feature} A new option 'Patient Name' in the Site Text section of Settings > Paperless Registration is added. This enables the display of 'Patient Name' and DOB on the  eRegistration Form.
- {:.feature} Insurance cards with Member ID that have spaces or dashes in them will be recognized and populated in the Member ID field after the patient types the initial 3 characters.
- {:.feature} The application has been updated to narrow the search results to pharmacies close to the patient ZIP code.

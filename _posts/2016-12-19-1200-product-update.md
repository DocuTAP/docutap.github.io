## Today's Patients

Updates to today's patients have continued with the introduction of views, filters and pre-selected
dates. We hope these updates allow you to more easily navigate to the patient data of interest
to you.

## User Management

We've released a major update to our user management capabilities. You can now create customized
user roles that restrict access to different pages within the Clockwise.MD application.
For example, you can use this feature to restrict your kiosk user to only be able to see the
Check-In Kiosk screen.

This builds on our password policy feature which allows you to tailor your staff member's password
requirements to your internal IT password policies.

## Support Sidebar

Your organization can now choose to remove the blue support sidebar that appears on the right side
of every Clockwise.MD page. This will only be applicable for enterprise organizations that wish to
use their own internal IT team as the first-line of support for Clockwise.MD questions or issues.

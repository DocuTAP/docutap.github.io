Upcoming changes to Callback Times, Android App and Reports.

### Callback Times

#### Current functionality

You'll note on the Callback Time column that:

- The date 3/25/2016 is repeated for every patient.
- The 5th patient down has a delay time of 09:42 AM.
- Once the patient checks in, that delayed time of 09:42 AM will no longer be shown.
- The time being displayed is the earliest expected callback time even when the patient is delayed or late.

#### Upcoming functionality

In an upcoming release, we're making a few changes to the Callback Time column:

- Instead of showing the earliest expected callback time, we're showing the current callback time.
- The patients will always be in the right order.
- We've removed the date since your patients are all visiting on the same day.
- Patients that have been "pushed back" due to a delay at your clinic and have received a
delay text message.
- Patients that are "late arrivals" are patients that haven't checked-in yet and are running behind.

When clicking on the 'i' icon:

- The info popup will include all key times that we've communicated to the patient.
- "Current Callback" is their actual callback time as seen on the wait room TV.
- "Last expected via SMS" is the latest expected time sent to them via SMS/Text if they were
given an updated time after their "First expected".
- "First expected" is the initial time communicated to the patient.

The nurse screen will be updated as well:

- Instead of showing the earliest expected callback time, we're showing the current callback time.
- The patients will always be in the right order.
- We've removed the date since your patients are all visiting on the same day.
- The patient's time will continue to color red if their actual wait time exceeds their expected
callback times.

### Android App Update

Many of you use the Matricom G-Box Q devices to display your wait times on your TVs.
[Matricom has announced an over-the-air (OTA) upgrade to Android 5](http://matricom.net/g-box-q-android-5-ota-firmware-update-20/).

The upgrade to Android 5 has impacted the UrgentQ app download from the Google Play Store.
UrgentQ is used to display your wait room times. With Android 5, the existing UrgentQ application
doesn't make it easy to update the URL.

We've completely revamped the Android application to make it even easier to configure with new and
existing sites. It also now supports all major versions of Android, versions 4 to 6
(Ice Cream Sandwich to Marshmallow).

<div class='updates notice'>

The UrgentQ application will be updated on the Google Play Store starting 4/11/2016.

### New Reports Preview

We're excited to announce an updated Reports system that includes:

- Graphs in addition to your existing table formatted data.
- Export any chart or table to Image and CSV.
- Ability to send reports via email on a recurring basis as PDF or CSV files.
- 5 different types of reports including the current report but also detailed reports on
Wait Time Accuracy, ROI, Patient Throughput and Patient Breakdown.

Over the next month, we're looking for feedback as you'll be able to use your existing reports
alongside previewing our new reports system.

This will available starting mid-April.

#### Fixes

- {:.fix} The application has been updated to no longer be case sensitive regarding email addresses for the SSO feature.
- {:.fix} There was an issue if the clinic sets a queue's confirmation message up with a reason exception.Â  The application was only sending default messages for all other types of messages on that queue, but this now resolved.
- {:.fix} The Add Scheduled Patient page now has a Cancel button to eliminate the need to use the browser back button because that causes refresh issues.
